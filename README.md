# scher

scher (pronounced 'escher') is an experimental library for symbolic testing of Haskell programs. 
It's under heavy development and should be considered experimental software for all intents and purposes.

scher requires the use of the simplified jhc compiler that you can find [here](http://www.github.com/m-alvarez/jhc).
You will also need to install the [Klee](klee.github.io) symbolic execution engine. Support for SMACK is planned.

In order to run scher tests, you will need to use an additional program that is currently unavailable.
